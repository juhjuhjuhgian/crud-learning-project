This project was made as a code-along with MayanWolfe's video tutorial as a form of practice and learning. What I learned: 1)What CRUD is! 2) What Express and MongoDB are. 3) Learning to use npm to install dependencies within the terminal. 4) Running and testing the server in the terminal and browser. 5) What an endpoint and callback are within the GET method. 6) Installing and using Nodemon to restart the server automagically. 7) POST request through a form element and its three components (action, method, name). 8) Body-parser which is middleware used to help clean up a request object. 9) Creating a database within MongoDB and connecting it to the server.js file. 10) Updating and Deleting
